PlayDate is a playdate service that matches you to another dog to play with. The feature I have built is the chat function.

## The main packages required for this feature are
- Node Js
- Express Js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express-sessions
- Express-socket.io-sessions


## Clone to your folder by using

```

## Start the project by running
